To use, just use Visual Studio to clone this repositry. Then open in the Unity Hub (Add > locate the folder). Unity will open with the project. You may have to go to scenes>SampleScene (will be renamed later) to open up the world.


If you have added your additions, merge or start a pull request in Visual Studio, and I will add it to the main project. It will show changes, and all you have to do is click commit, and then pull / pull request.
